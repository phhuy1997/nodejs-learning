1. What is Babel?
   It is a Compiler to convert newest codes from JS (ES7) to origin JS (ES1)
   so that computer can understand, code can be run on many application without dependening on which version

--> No need to use Babel because it take double memory to contain the converted code.

--> Recommend: We will update and use newest version of NodeJs (ex: 14.17.0)
